# mean_nearest_neighbor
Simple script that calculates the mean of the distance of cells of one type to their closest cell of another cell type (type_2). This is done for each _ROI_ in each _image_.

Uses the columns of the tsv file as follows:

0: image_name, 1: cell_class, 2: ROI_name, 3: distance_to_type_2 (in Âµm)
